# NOTE: This is a minimal configuration for initial implementation.
# Full privacy controls and sanitization will be implemented in Layer 2.
# See docs/architecture/layer2_async_pipeline.md for details.

  # Data categories to opt out of capturing
  # Currently supported in hooks:
  opt_out:
    - file_paths      # Hash file paths instead of storing
    - error_messages  # Redact error messages to error type only

  # NOTE: Future implementation (Layer 2):
  # - Comprehensive data sanitization
  # - Content redaction
  # - Data retention policies
  # - GDPR compliance features
  # - Export and deletion capabilities
