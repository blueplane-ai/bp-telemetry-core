notes: |
  This migration renames the conversations table to claude_conversations
  for clarity, as the table is specific to Claude Code interactions.

  The Python implementation includes additional logic to:
  - Check if the table exists before renaming
  - Handle index renaming with pattern matching
  - Gracefully handle the case where the table was already renamed

  For production use, the inline Python migration provides more robust
  handling of edge cases.
